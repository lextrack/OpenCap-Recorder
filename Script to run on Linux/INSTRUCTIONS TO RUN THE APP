1. Make sure both files are in the same folder:
   - app.py
   - run.sh
   - requirements.txt (if needed)

2. Open a terminal in that folder.

3. Create the virtual environment (only once):
   python3 -m venv venv

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   source venv/bin/activate

5. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

6. Give execution permission to the launcher script (only once):
   chmod +x run.sh

7. Run the app using:
   ./run.sh

The script will automatically activate the virtual environment and run the application.

Requirements:
